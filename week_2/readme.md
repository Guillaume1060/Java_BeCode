## Week 2

#### Ideal flow of the learning track

By now, students are able to create rudimentary programs that handle some sort of automation. They 
know the basic syntax, they can make classes and interfaces, have basic knowledge of collections and 
generics. 

In week 2, I think we should deepen that knowledge of collections, some new keywords and tackle the 
functions and the functional api in Java. This api and keywords is quite a big topic and understanding 
collections and generics well is in my opinion a must. Students will also encounter 'Optionals'.

* There are 2 new keywords to learn: Static keyword and the final keyword. Both need some good 
  understanding, they aren't just keywords. Enumeration types go together with static and final. Students
  should understand what enumerations are and as extra: why are they related to static and final?
* Comparing objects
* Functions, functional java and streams. 
* From large collections, be able to filter, be able to map/reduce and collect results. 

For this to work well, students will have to understand what it means to work with types. Collections
are basically groups of types. Elements inside a collection are bound to the contract of the generic 
type. This means understanding that a type defines behaviour, it defines what an object in a collection 
can do. 


  #### Goals for week 2:

  * Be able to use the static keyword properly (base for the singleton pattern) and thus also understand what it does
  * Be able to use the final keyword properly and understand what it does
  * Be able to use enumerations. 
  * Introducing nested collections and be comfortable with it.
  * Generics part 2: be able to write generic code. (coupled challenge: write your own Stack implementation)
  * Be able to write functions in java and functional interfaces
  * Be able to read and write lambdas. Understand that lambdas are anonymous functions and can sometimes hurt readability.
  * The java 8 steaming api: Map/Reduce/Collect with lambdas
  * Understand clojures in java (basically it is lambdas that use variables outside their scope)
  * Understanding what 'types' are.
    Understand that types are actually just abstractions that tell you what objects can do.
  * Work with optionals, know what they are and how to use them.
