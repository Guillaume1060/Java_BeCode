# Challenge's Evaluation

This document aims to enable you to get feedback on your work during this challenge. It does so by **clarifying the learning objectives** as well as **specifying the success criterium**. For instance, this challenge aims to develop your ability to **setup and write basic OOP project** which translates to the following learning goals:

- Know about the origin and the intent of true object oriented programming: What you are learning today isn't how OO was really meant to be.
- Understand what coupling is, what cohesion is and how they both impact change in code.
- Understanding OO concepts such as abstraction and encapsulation, the idea of abstraction in java and coding in general. How does encapsulation relate to the origin of object oriented programming?
- Understand abstract classes and abstract methods: What are they?
- Understand inheritance: what is method overloading vs method overriding?
- Understand the diamond problem
- Understand why inheritance and encapsulation are most of the time conflicting (extra).
- Understand polymorphism and its relation to abstraction. Know how to use polymorphism in java.
- Testing classes using JUnit.
- Be able to set up a project using Maven. Know what you can do with Maven.
- Set up a simple logging framework
- Look at project Lombok and see what it can do for you.

From there you can use the table below to assess the successful development of this competency. It can be used by you or someone else (_coach_, _coworker_, _etc..._) when paired with a **grading system** (ex: _"I"nsufficient_, _"S"ufficient_, _"G"ood_) to get an assessment of your work.

| Criteria         | Indicator                                                   | Subjectivity |
|:-----------------|:------------------------------------------------------------|:-------------|
| **Completeness** | All the "commands" have been implemented as classes         | low          |
|                  | Unit tests have been written for each classes               | low          |
|                  | The code base is managed using Maven                        | low          |
| **Correctness**  | The program passes all the tests                            | low          |
|                  | The program builds, with Maven,  without warnings or errors | low          |

The headers can be summarized as follow:

- **Criteria**: a measurable benchmark to analyze a competency development.
- **Indicator**: the observable elements that indicates if a criteria has been meet or not.
- **Subjectivity**: the estimated level of personal opinion required to judge an indicator success ("_low_", "_medium_" or "_high_").

> **NOTE**: Criteria can be either a "**must have**" or a "_nice to have_" depending on their importance in regards to the competency.
