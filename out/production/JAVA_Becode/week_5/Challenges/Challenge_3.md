# Challenge 3: Data analysis tool

- Repository: `java_week_5`

- Type of Challenge: `Learning`

- Team challenge : `solo`

  

## The Mission

Turn the data analysis tool you made in week 3 into a REST application. Again, think very carefully about what is going
to be a resource! The goal is to create a data analysis tool from a static data source. There are a lot of possibilities 
here, and depending on what you choose to be a resource, the api can be very REST-conform, or it can resemble more of 
an RPC kind of style (which would be considered to be bad practice).
