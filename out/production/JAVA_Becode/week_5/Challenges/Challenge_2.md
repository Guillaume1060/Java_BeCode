# Challenge 2: Write a client application to consume your own api

- Repository: `java_week_5`

- Type of Challenge: `Learning`

- Team challenge : `solo`

  

## The Mission

Keep it simple for this one. Just write a small application that can perform a POST request and a GET request to some of the
API endpoints you just created in the previous challenge. This application doesn't need to resemble something you would
present to actual users. You are a developers, and sometimes developers needs custom made tools to test something, to try
out something, etc. The main idea here is that you at least have experienced building a client using a framework. 

You can try using spring resttemplate or something more lightweight such as Retrofit
