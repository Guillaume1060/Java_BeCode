# Resources

## Spring related

- Starting with spring, I will have some resources already, especially example code
- anything coming from Baeldung will be valuable.

## Inversion of control and dependency injection

- https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/131446/what-is-inversion-of-control-and-when-should-i-use-it
- This link can also be found in the article linked before this: http://codebetter.com/jeremymiller/2008/06/29/some-concepts-to-know-first/. From this page, 
there is a quote you should bear in mind when doing Object Oriented programming:

```markdown
To sum it all up, well designed Object Oriented systems are composed of many objects that work with each other to accomplish 
to goals of the system.  We want our systems to be decomposed into cohesive classes that perform a well defined responsibility 
within the system, rather than monolithic “God” classes that do too much.  A cohesive class will have to be dependent 
upon other classes to perform services outside of its own tightly defined responsibility.  In IoC speak, we call the 
collaborating objects dependencies. 
```

## Maven

- https://maven.apache.org/guides/getting-started/ 
- I will also provide small maven projects to demonstrate simple maven things.
