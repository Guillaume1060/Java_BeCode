## The Mission

- Here are the proposed themes:

  - Events
  - News portal
  - Promote craftsmanship
  - Tourism 
  - Dating 



### Events

An event platform is the ideal media support to provoke or follow an event. It makes it possible to offer direct or deferred information on various events to as many people as possible. It offers the possibility of making available to different audiences multimedia content (text, image, sound, video) giving maximum and attractive coverage to the event or the promotional campaign.



### News portal

There are many news platforms, but there are two categories, those that are generalist and those that focus on a single theme. The generalist news platform features articles on topics such as politics, social, sports, entertainment, and more.



### Promote craftsmanship

All countries are complaining about a drop in activity in the craft industry. The industrial revolution, mass production and competition from emerging countries have literally destroyed a large part of the craft industry. Nowadays, craftsmanship is rather considered as a sector of the past where we see people trying to survive from day to day. But this is a false image conveyed by the media and the consumer society. Numerous studies show a huge upsurge in interest in handicrafts. The latter are more authentic and they benefit from an irreproachable finish unlike the products produced on the assembly line. Unfortunately, craftsmen are rarely present on the web, because they think that a platform creation dedicated to craftsmanship is not interesting when it is the opposite.



### Tourism 

Tourism sites are invading the web, each hotel, restaurant and tourist attraction has its own website. Tourism is very profitable, especially with the diversity of monetization techniques. The creation of a platform on tourism involves an in-depth research of the competition, but also of the approach to the content strategy and the services that we want to offer. Basically, you can create two main tourism platform, one that focuses on content with articles that describe attractions, accommodations and restaurants. And we have the one that offers online reservations for plane tickets and hotels.



### Dating 

In general, the community networking system is a very open service and accessible on a simple registration. Creating a dating platform based on this system therefore allows an individual to find one of his old friends by registering on the platform. Such a platform offers an interactive program that makes it possible to weave or establish interpersonal contacts. This new aspect of community networking is technically akin to social media that intensifies the social system of the network while encouraging correlation between members. This meeting on the web can also take the form of an exchange of opinions on human relationships, occupations, events and cultural subjects. Dating platform can each have their own specialization. They can be distinguished by the community networking system and the network mode used. These are the open network, the network by invitation of a member and the network paid by registration. The open network is accessible to all Internet users and is only very insecure. The network by invitation of a member is based on the authorization of access to the platform by a member and this, thanks to a solicitation made by another member of the platform. The pay-per-registration network is only accessible in return for a financial contribution or membership fee to the platform.
