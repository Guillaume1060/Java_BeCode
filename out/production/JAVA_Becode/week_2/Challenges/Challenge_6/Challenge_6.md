## The Mission

Using the same csv file, write a program that will output the highest export value of the year 2019, 
the country is China, the commodity is 'all' and the transport mode is also 'all'. There are multiple
solutions to do this: by using a method of the streaming api or by sorting and finding the highest value.

Try them both. 

**Extra:** The output of the program needs to be the sum instead of the highest value.
