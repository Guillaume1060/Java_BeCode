# Challenge 4: More filtering and even more transforming

- Repository: `java_week_2`

- Type of Challenge: `Learning`

- Team challenge : `solo`

  

## The Mission

Using the same csv file, write a program that will print the values for export and import every single
day but instead of in dollars, we want to see the values in euros, and this for the year of 2016. Currently, 
1 dollar is about 0.85 euro. Be careful though! Not every line has a value expressed in dollar!

**Extra:** Write the program in such a way that we can easily choose a different exchange rate.
