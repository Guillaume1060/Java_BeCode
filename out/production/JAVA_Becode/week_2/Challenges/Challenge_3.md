## The Mission

Using the same csv file about effects of covid 19 on trade, write a small program that will print 
the values for both import and the export every day for the year 2016, where the country value is 'all'. 

**Tip:** it can be useful to transform the lines first into an object. 

**Question:** do you think for this challenge that you need an object with all fields mentioned in 
the header of the csv file?

**Extra:** Write the program in such a way so that we can search for a specific country instead, it could
be any country.
