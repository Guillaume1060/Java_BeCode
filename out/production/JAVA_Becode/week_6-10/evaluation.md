# Challenge's Evaluation

This document aims to enable you to get feedback on your work during this challenge. It does so by **clarifying the learning objectives** as well as **specifying the success criterium**. For instance, this challenge aims to develop your ability to **setup and write basic OOP project** which translates to the following learning goals:

- Consolidate the Java syntax.
- Consolidate the use of `Maven`.
- Consolidate the use of unit tests.
- Consolidate OOP principles.

From there you can use the table below to assess the successful development of this competency. It can be used by you or someone else (_coach_, _coworker_, _etc..._) when paired with a **grading system** (ex: _"I"nsufficient_, _"S"ufficient_, _"G"ood_) to get an assessment of your work.

| Criteria         | Indicator                                                       | Subjectivity |
|:-----------------|:----------------------------------------------------------------|:-------------|
| **Completeness** | Both part of the project, API and client, have been implemented | low          |
|                  | Unit tests have been written where it makes sense               | low          |
|                  | The code base is managed using Maven                            | low          |
| **Correctness**  | The program passes all the tests                                | low          |
|                  | The program builds, with Maven, without warnings or errors      | low          |

The headers can be summarized as follow:

- **Criteria**: a measurable benchmark to analyze a competency development.
- **Indicator**: the observable elements that indicates if a criteria has been meet or not.
- **Subjectivity**: the estimated level of personal opinion required to judge an indicator success ("_low_", "_medium_" or "_high_").

> **NOTE**: Criteria can be either a "**must have**" or a "_nice to have_" depending on their importance in regards to the competency.
