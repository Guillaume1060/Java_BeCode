    // Challenge 1
    byte aByte = 127;
    short aShort = 32_767;
    int anInt = 2_147_483_646;
    long aLong = 9_223_372_036_854_775_807L;
    float aFloat = 7.55f;
    double aDouble = 5.55;
    char aChar = 'Z';
    boolean aBoolean = true;

    // Challenge 2
//    These are objects. Primitive data types are raw values, but objects are not.
//    Objects are actually pointers, they point to memory in the jvm.
//    So a variable of type Integer can also NOT have a pointer, which makes it 'null'.
//    Very extra:
//    Is there a way to loop over all of the variables automatically and only have 1 print statement? If so, why was this not possible the primitive datatypes?
